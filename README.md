# IBFS with lower memory consumption and floating point capacity support

This is the modified version of IBFS solver for max-flow min-cut problem:

 - Lower memory consumption by using ```unsigned int``` instead of pointers (can easily be switched to ```size_t``` by ```node_index_t``` typedef)
 - Capacity type changed from ```int``` to ```float``` (can easilty be switched to double/int/etc by ```capacity_t``` typedef)
 - Number of edges from each node limited to ```MAX_ARCS_PER_NODE``` (MAX_ARCS_PER_NODE=4 tested - useful for Delaunay tetrahedralization, dinamic number of edges can be recovered)
 - Some functions were removed because I didn't need them, but they can be recovered

If you need good alternative - BK-solver is great and cheap for commercial usage. See [**fork**](https://github.com/PolarNick239/bk_maxflow) with lower memory consumption.
